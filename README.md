# WAC_bioinformatics
The code available was used in the transcriptomics and proteomics analysis for WAC gene in Cabezudo et al, 2025. This study reanalysed LinkedOmicsKB data, which was generated by The Clinical Proteomic TUmor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC, DOI: 10.1016/j.cels.2023.07.007).

In 001_proteomics.R you'll find the code to process the proteomics data and generate the corresponding figures. In 002_transcriptomics.R you'll find the code for the transcriptomics analysis and figures.
